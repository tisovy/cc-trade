## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Confirmed order updates survive an older account snapshot
The system SHALL treat a confirmed execution report as authoritative until the
account snapshot it is reconciled against is at least as recent. An account
snapshot SHALL NOT replace an open order with an older version of that same
order.

An order the exchange has reported settled SHALL NOT be listed as working again,
by any message. This covers both a report that left the exchange before the
settlement — the reply to a placement that filled the instant it was made — and
an account snapshot read from a service that had not yet seen the settlement.
Settlement is remembered by the order's exchange identity rather than compared by
time, because the exchange does not reuse an order id; the memory SHALL be
bounded, since it guards messages in flight rather than recording history. A
settlement report that carries no order id SHALL settle nothing, its identity
being the prefix every unidentified order on that contract would share.

#### Scenario: Snapshot arrives with pre-amendment values
- **WHEN** an amendment is confirmed and the account synchronization that follows returns the order with an earlier update time
- **THEN** the order keeps the confirmed price and size, and no operator refresh is required to see them

#### Scenario: Snapshot is newer than the local report
- **WHEN** the account snapshot reports the order with a later update time than the last locally applied report
- **THEN** the snapshot values replace the local ones

#### Scenario: The placement's reply arrives after the fill
- **WHEN** an order fills the instant it is placed, so the stream reports it filled before the reply to the placement arrives describing it as new
- **THEN** the order is not listed as working, and no reload is required to clear it

#### Scenario: A snapshot still describes a settled order
- **WHEN** an account snapshot lists an order the exchange has already reported settled, alongside an order that is genuinely resting
- **THEN** the settled one is refused and the resting one is listed

### Requirement: Order reconciliation remains current after startup
After the first snapshot, the system SHALL combine authenticated user-data
updates with periodic and operator-requested REST reconciliation so that missed
stream events or reconnects do not leave the visible order state permanently
incorrect. The periodic read SHALL run while orders are working and SHALL stop
while none are, so that a desk holding nothing spends no weight on it.

#### Scenario: User-data stream reconnects
- **WHEN** the authenticated stream disconnects and reconnects
- **THEN** the system marks stream-derived order state stale until a REST reconciliation succeeds

#### Scenario: Manual refresh completes
- **WHEN** the operator requests an account refresh and both order sources succeed
- **THEN** the visible selected-symbol orders match the new account-wide snapshots and their freshness becomes ready

#### Scenario: No message reports a settlement
- **WHEN** orders are working and no execution report or snapshot arrives
- **THEN** the account is re-read without the operator asking, on a beat measured in tens of seconds

#### Scenario: Nothing is working
- **WHEN** the working-orders list is empty
- **THEN** no periodic read is sent at all
