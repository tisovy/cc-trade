## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A drag lifts the order off the book
Beginning a drag on a working order SHALL cancel that order. The drag SHALL
begin only once the cancellation is confirmed; if it is refused or its outcome is
unknown, the order SHALL be left alone and no drag SHALL start. Once the
cancellation is confirmed the order SHALL leave the chart, the order list and
every other surface that lists working orders, because it no longer exists.

#### Scenario: The operator picks an order up
- **WHEN** the operator begins a drag on a working order and the exchange confirms the cancellation
- **THEN** the order is no longer listed as working and no longer drawn at the price it rested at

#### Scenario: The cancellation is refused
- **WHEN** the exchange refuses the cancellation
- **THEN** no drag begins, the order remains working and drawn where it was, and the refusal is stated

#### Scenario: The cancellation's outcome is unknown
- **WHEN** the cancellation is sent and the exchange does not confirm it either way
- **THEN** no drag begins and the unknown outcome is presented as unknown, so the operator is not told the order is gone

### Requirement: The order being dragged is drawn
While a drag is in flight the order that will be placed SHALL be drawn at the
price under the pointer, carrying its side and its size, and SHALL be the only
mark on the chart standing for it. The price the order was lifted from MAY carry
one faint marker, distinct from a working order and without an axis label.

#### Scenario: An order is being dragged
- **WHEN** an order is being dragged across the chart
- **THEN** it is drawn once, at the pointer, and no working-order mark for it remains at the price it was lifted from

#### Scenario: Other orders during a drag
- **WHEN** one order is being dragged and others rest on the same contract
- **THEN** the others keep their lines, labels and handles unchanged

### Requirement: A drag owes a replacement
From the moment a lifted order's cancellation is confirmed, the system SHALL owe
a replacement order and SHALL discharge that obligation in exactly one of three
ways: by placing the replacement at the price the drag ended on, by placing it
again at the price it was lifted from when the drag is abandoned, or by stating
that neither could be placed. The third case SHALL name the order that is gone,
state why the replacement failed, and offer to place it again. It SHALL NOT be
reported only in a log.

#### Scenario: The drag ends at a new price
- **WHEN** the operator drops a dragged order at a price the desk accepts
- **THEN** a replacement order is placed at that price

#### Scenario: The drag is abandoned
- **WHEN** the operator abandons the drag by releasing the modifier, by cancelling, or by dropping at the price the order was lifted from
- **THEN** the order is placed again at the price it was lifted from

#### Scenario: The replacement cannot be placed
- **WHEN** the replacement is refused by the exchange or by a local limit
- **THEN** the desk states that the order was cancelled and not replaced, names it, gives the reason, and offers to place it again

#### Scenario: The replacement's outcome is unknown
- **WHEN** the replacement is sent and its outcome is not confirmed
- **THEN** it is presented as unknown and no further replacement is placed automatically, because a second attempt could leave two orders on the book
