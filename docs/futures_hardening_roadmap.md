# Futures And Hardening Roadmap

This document is the implementation roadmap for stabilizing the current spot terminal and adding futures support safely.

## Guardrails

- Do not change the existing `0.999` quantity reduction behavior unless explicitly approved later.
- Do not remove or remap existing keyboard/mouse shortcuts unless explicitly approved later.
- UI changes must be incremental, small, and reviewed before expanding the surface area.
- Prefer non-UI safety and contract work before adding new visible futures controls.
- Futures must not be added by extending spot order handlers with ad hoc fields.

## Current State

- Frontend: React/Vite/Electron renderer.
- Backend: Electron main process plus Node services using `@binance/spot`.
- No Python service is present in this workspace.
- Market data is partly on the newer channel protocol.
- Renderer trading commands use the versioned typed protocol; the legacy WebSocket protocol (`buyOrder`, `sellOrder`, `cancelOrder`) remains available for compatibility.
- Spot order execution is currently limited to `LIMIT` + `GTC`.
- E2E builds keep DevTools closed by default; remaining E2E work should focus on deterministic state and selectors.

## Product Direction

The terminal should keep the current fast spot workflow, then add futures as a distinct trading mode:

- Spot and futures instruments must be separate domain entities.
- Futures UI must make leverage, margin mode, position side, reduce-only state, funding, and liquidation risk explicit.
- Futures execution should first ship as read-only, then testnet execution, then guarded production.

## Phase 1: Non-UI Safety Hardening

Goal: reduce operational and security risk without changing the visible workflow.

1. [x] Remove analytics secret exposure from the renderer bundle and localStorage.
2. [x] Gate `openDevTools()` behind a development flag so packaged and E2E builds do not open DevTools by default.
3. [x] Add local WebSocket access control:
   - bind explicitly to localhost;
   - validate origin where possible;
   - add a per-session token/nonce between Electron main and renderer.
4. [x] Add command-level validation and rejection messages in the backend for malformed order/cancel requests.
5. [x] Keep current spot order behavior unchanged, including the `0.999` quantity reduction.

Acceptance:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
- No visual UI changes.
- Existing spot order payload behavior remains unchanged.

## Phase 2: E2E Stabilization

Goal: make regression checks reliable before larger architecture work.

1. [x] Update E2E app-window selection to ignore DevTools windows.
2. [x] Disable DevTools in E2E unless explicitly requested.
3. [x] Reset or control persisted localStorage state in tests (`currentView`, mock WS URL, chart config).
4. [x] Update stale selectors for current UI structure.
5. [x] Ensure mock WebSocket messages cover both legacy and channel protocol paths where tests need them.

Acceptance:

- `npm run test:e2e` passes locally.
- E2E failures indicate product regressions, not harness/window-selection issues.

## Phase 3: Trading Command Contract

Goal: replace legacy stringly-typed trading requests with a typed command surface.

Introduce a versioned command protocol:

```js
{
  action: "trade.placeOrder",
  version: 1,
  marketType: "spot",
  accountId: "default",
  clientOrderId: "...",
  symbol: "BTCUSDT",
  side: "BUY",
  orderType: "LIMIT",
  timeInForce: "GTC",
  price: "50000.00",
  quantity: "0.010000"
}
```

Required command families:

- `trade.placeOrder`
- `trade.cancelOrder`
- `trade.replaceOrder`
- `trade.cancelAll`
- `account.refresh`

Rules:

- Keep legacy protocol during migration.
- Add typed commands behind adapter functions first.
- Do not change UI flows in this phase.

Progress:

- [x] Add typed spot command builders and legacy adapters for current place/cancel flow.
- [x] Add backend validation/dispatch for `trade.placeOrder`, `trade.cancelOrder`, and `account.refresh`.
- [x] Define `trade.replaceOrder` and `trade.cancelAll` with explicit disabled-command backend rejection.
- [x] Migrate the spot UI wire protocol from legacy messages to typed command messages after the adapter path is proven.

Acceptance:

- Existing spot UI can place/cancel orders through the adapter path.
- Legacy protocol remains available until tests and UI are migrated.

## Phase 4: Spot Adapter Boundary

Goal: isolate current spot behavior before adding futures.

Create a spot adapter with this shape:

```js
class SpotTradingAdapter {
  getExchangeInfo(symbol) {}
  getAccountState() {}
  getOpenOrders(symbol) {}
  getTradeHistory(symbol) {}
  placeOrder(command) {}
  cancelOrder(command) {}
}
```

Move spot-specific assumptions into the adapter:

- spot account balances;
- spot exchange filters;
- spot open orders;
- spot user-data stream normalization;
- `LIMIT/GTC` default handling.

Progress:

- [x] Map current spot backend responsibilities in `electron/services/binance-connection.js`:
  - spot account balances: REST `getAccount`, nonzero free/locked filtering, renderer `{ balances }` payloads;
  - spot exchange filters: REST `exchangeInfo`, `MIN_NOTIONAL` / `PRICE_FILTER` / `LOT_SIZE` parsing, global `{ filters }` payloads;
  - spot open orders: REST `getOpenOrders`, renderer `{ orders }` payloads;
  - spot trade history: REST `myTrades({ limit: 500 })`, renderer `{ history }` payloads;
  - spot order execution: validated `LIMIT/GTC` `newOrder`, `FULL` response normalization, post-order account refresh;
  - spot order cancellation: validated `deleteOrder`, cancellation execution normalization, post-cancel account refresh;
  - spot user-data stream normalization: `executionReport`, `outboundAccountPosition`, and `balanceUpdate` broadcasts;
  - non-spot concerns still in the service: local WebSocket access control, renderer connection lifecycle, ticker streams, market chart/depth/trade streams, mock mode.
- [x] Add the first `SpotTradingAdapter` seam for current spot exchange/account/order REST operations while preserving legacy and typed command behavior.
- [x] Move spot user-data stream normalization behind adapter-owned helpers while preserving renderer `execution_update` / `balance_update` payloads and REST balance-refresh triggers.
- [x] Move spot account-refresh payload construction and refresh operation weights behind adapter-owned helpers while preserving renderer `balances` / `orders` / `history` payloads, rate-limit weights, and post-place/post-cancel sequencing.
- [x] Reuse adapter-owned account snapshot operations for initial detail-channel spot balances / open orders / trade history fetches while preserving renderer payloads and rate-limit weights.
- [x] Move spot user-data stream listen-key creation and renewal behind adapter-owned helpers while preserving stream setup, keep-alive behavior, and rate-limit weights.
- [x] Keep current spot order placement `LIMIT/GTC` defaults owned by the adapter while preserving renderer payloads and REST order parameters.
- [x] Move mock spot order-placement execution report construction behind an adapter-owned helper while preserving the existing renderer payload shape.
- [x] Restore per-operation refresh failure isolation after the account-operation extraction so balances, open orders, and history still run sequentially after an exhausted operation failure.
- [x] Move the spot server-time REST request behind the adapter while preserving clock-drift validation, logging, and startup behavior.
- [ ] Move spot user-data WebSocket connection creation behind the adapter without changing reconnect, teardown, or keep-alive timing.
- [ ] Reuse adapter-owned balance refresh operation metadata for stream-triggered shared balance refreshes.
- [ ] Add service-level orchestration coverage before changing higher-risk subscription or trading flows.

Acceptance:

- Spot behavior remains identical from the user's perspective.
- Order/balance/history parsing is easier to test in isolation.

## Phase 5: Futures Read-Only Mode

Goal: add futures data without allowing futures execution yet.

Add a futures adapter for read-only endpoints and streams:

- exchange info and futures filters;
- mark price;
- index price;
- funding rate/countdown;
- positions;
- margin balance;
- unrealized PnL;
- liquidation price;
- open futures orders.

UI surface should be minimal:

- one small market-mode indicator/switch;
- futures read-only position strip/panel;
- no futures order submit controls yet.

Acceptance:

- Futures read-only can run on testnet or mock data.
- Spot UI remains unchanged when market mode is spot.
- No visible futures execution controls.

## Phase 6: Futures Testnet Execution

Goal: enable futures order placement only on testnet first.

Required command fields:

- `marketType`
- `positionSide`
- `marginType`
- `leverage`
- `reduceOnly`
- `workingType`
- `priceProtect`
- `clientOrderId`

Required safety gates:

- stale mark price block;
- max leverage cap;
- max notional cap;
- reduce-only validation;
- liquidation distance warning;
- backend-side validation independent of frontend.

UI surface:

- controlled futures order ticket;
- explicit Long/Short selector;
- leverage and margin mode controls;
- reduce-only toggle;
- order preview before submit.

Acceptance:

- Testnet-only execution.
- All risky actions emit clear backend acknowledgements/rejections.
- UI changes reviewed before expanding beyond the order ticket.

## Phase 7: Guarded Production Futures Rollout

Goal: allow real futures execution with hard limits and rollback.

Required controls:

- feature flag for production futures;
- account-level max leverage;
- max order notional;
- max daily notional;
- kill switch;
- cancel-all positions/orders affordance;
- audit log for every command and response.

Acceptance:

- Production futures cannot be enabled accidentally.
- Real execution requires explicit configuration and a visible account/mode indicator.

## UI Rollout Rules

Every UI change should be reviewed as a small checkpoint:

1. Add the minimum visible affordance.
2. Verify desktop screenshot and core workflow.
3. Get user review.
4. Only then add the next control.

Suggested UI order:

1. Non-invasive account/mode status line.
2. Read-only futures position strip.
3. Futures risk metrics in a compact panel.
4. Futures order ticket in testnet.
5. Production futures controls after safety gates.

## Start Here Next Session

Continue Phase 4 with the smallest unchecked backend-only seam:

**Move spot user-data WebSocket connection creation behind `SpotTradingAdapter`.**

Implementation entry points:

- `electron/services/binance-connection.js`
- `electron/services/spot-trading-adapter.js`
- `electron/services/spot-trading-adapter.test.js`

Expected scope:

- Preserve the exact `{ stream: listenKey }` WebSocket connection parameters.
- Keep reconnect, teardown, and keep-alive ownership in the connection service.
- Do not change renderer payloads, rate-limit weights, typed or legacy command behavior, or futures execution state.
